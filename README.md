# TheFinalFrontier
Windows Starfield screensaver implemented in Unity 2019

A personal project built to experiment with the S.O.L.I.D. principles in Object Oriented Programming

There a multiple interfaces that define the architect of the project which can be found in the Tools folder.

Each interface has a dedicated folder that has the implementation for it. If a new and/or better implentation is designed, you can create a new class that extends the respective interface and then instantiate the interface with the new class to swap funtionality.

You can check out the build for the project here:
